    <h1>Ibad Desmukh</h1>
    <p>I am a systems software engineer, deeply interested in using computers to solve problems for benefiting humanity. I have been writing programs since I was 10 years old. I received a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Computing and Information Systems with Distinction, from Queen Mary University of London in 2024. There, I dove into exploring advanced computer architecture, algorithms and low-level programming. I live in Liverpool, United Kingdom.</p>

    <p>
    Currently, I am:
    <ul>
        <li>Researching hardware-software co-design and domain-specific architectures for the current post-Moore's law era. Areas of interest include field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), neuromorphic computing and quantum computing.</li>
        <li>Working as a Data Analyst for a financial services company.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Long term goals:
    <ul>
        <li>Build highly efficient computers with near-infinite battery life and near-infinite computational power.</li>
        <li>Use these systems to solve challenging problems in physics, biology and chemistry to improve human lives.</li>
        <li>Reveal truths about the universe through computational exploration.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Past work:
    <ul>
        <li>I took a course at a college to learn programming in C++ when I was 10 years old. I have been involved in software and web development ever since.</li>
        <li>In middle school, I designed and developed a full-featured website for Real-Time Information Services, an information technology services company based in California, United States.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        Still round the corner there may wait<br>
        A new road or a secret gate,<br>
        And though we pass them by today,<br>
        Tomorrow we may come this way<br>
        And take the hidden paths that run<br>
        Towards the Moon or to the Sun.<br>

    <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
    <h3>AgriSense: A scalable, systems-driven agricultural monitoring solution</h3>
    <p>Designed and implemented a low-cost, wireless agricultural field monitoring system leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi. Integrated real-time data processing with fuzzy logic and linear regression algorithms, optimized for performance across constrained environments. Developed firmware in C using FreeRTOS and Apache NimBLE, with a systems-level focus on modularity and portability. Hardware included Espressif ESP32-C3 and ESP32-S3 microcontrollers, Sensiron SHT41 temperature and humidity sensor, Rohm Semiconductor BH1750 light sensor, and capacitive soil moisture sensor.</p>
